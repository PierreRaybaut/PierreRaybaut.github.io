Why Write a Blog?
=================

This is my first post, which naturally leads to the question: why write a blog?

Motivation
----------

Let me take the risk of stating the obvious. For me, starting this blog is motivated by the following reasons:

- **Synthesizing my thoughts somewhere**: No other medium allows me to express my thoughts about open-source projects, new libraries, or techniques in such a structured way.

- **Sharing knowledge**: I have been a long-term advocate of Python in a scientific context. I have created tools like `Spyder`_, `Python(x,y)`_, and `WinPython`_, which have played a pivotal role in making Python a leading language for scientific computing. So, it might be worth sharing my thoughts and experiences with the community.

- **Connecting with the community**: I have been involved in the open-source software community for a long time, but I have always been more of a "silent" worker. Writing a blog is a way to connect with the community in a more direct way.

Trigger
-------

I always have been reluctant to start a blog. My main concerns were

1. **Time**: I was afraid that I would not be able to post regularly. I still am, but I decided to give it a try anyway.

2. **Ego**: The idea of writing a blog is **so ego-centric**. To clarify the fact that *I really don't think of my as a reference in any field*, I almost named this blog "The Ego-Centric Blog" or "My Humble Blog"... but I thought that would be too much of a clich√©, or even counter-productive, so I decided to stick with the current name which is more neutral.

   SciPy 2024 Conference kicking off, at the Great Tacoma Convention Center (WA, USA)

The trigger for starting this blog was my attendance at the 2024 SciPy conference. I gave a talk on my 15 years of experience with scientific Python and the lessons I have learned along the way. Preparing for this talk made me realize that I may have a lot to say about the subject. One of the contacts I made at the conference (*hey Paul!*) suggested that I start writing about things I haven't been able to present in my talk due to time constraints. *Challenge accepted!*
